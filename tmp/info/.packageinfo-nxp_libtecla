Description: 	The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive command line 
	editing facilities, similar to those of the UNIX tcsh shell. In addition to simple 
	command-line editing, it supports recall of previously entered command lines, 
	TAB completion of file names or other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of 
	filenames. The internal functions which perform file-name completion and wild-card 
	expansion are also available externally for optional use by programs.
